            <h1 class="margin text-center">Movie Webpage Project</h1>
            <h2> Context / Prompt </h2>
            <p> My teacher, Mr Mueller wanted me and a partner to work on a movie web-page project to practice our skills and everything we learned about basic HTML & CSS. </p>
            <h2> Content / Challenges </h2>
            <p> As briefly stated in the context / prompt section, Mr Mueller wanted me and a partner to work on a movie web-page project to put everything we've learned about basic HTML and CSS to test, this ranges from headers, paragraphs, divs, spans, fonts, element class and id, as well as importing local images and importing text-fonts. I honestly thought this project, at first was busy work and a way to get us to learn collaboration, but throughout this project I realized that this was more than that, me and my partner genuienly struggled on planning and had no idea where to start from, but we came up with the idea of a Mini Pekka going through life and eventually becoming a Pekka, a personal issue I faced in this project was optimising the web-page so it looked visually appealing, I couldn't figure out how to center images, texts and how to deal with divs & spans, but looking back on the free-code camp lessons and asking my partner for help, I got a grasp on how divs & spans worked, and how to organize the website properly. Collaboration was a huge part of this project and also research, the site "W3schools" Mr Mueller reccomended us was very helpful as it gave insight on how certain code worked, in this case divs & spans. </p>
            <h2> Takeaways </h2>
            <p> There's so many things I've learned from this project and it's refreshed the fundementals of HTML and CSS for me, but I believe that the most important thing is Collaboration and planning, without a proper plan, none of the code can be executed in a proper manner and the project will just be a mess. Planning took up the majority of our time and for good reason, without a strong base you cannot have a good project and I learned this after we restarted on the project twice. Mr Mueller made us do a plan.md that helped organize all of our ideas from the plot, the characters, the settings, what fonts we wanted to use and the overall theme of the movie-webpage, and this was huge in helping us lay out the project. Without collaboration, you can't get anywork done. The project would have came out much differently if me and my partner did not work together. Collaboration is huge in a project since two minds and opinions help provide a new perspective on certain parts of a project, and my partner helped educate me on some of the things I struggled with, and I helped explain to him on some of the parts of the project he struggled with.</p>
            <h2> Next Steps </h2>
            <p> In all honesty, if I had two more days to work on the project I think I would've changed the layout and made everything more visually appealing, I'm not too happy with how this project turned out but I'm not too upset either as there's more takeaways than anything. Some of the code wasn't as well written as I would have liked it to be, and I would have made the web-page more visually appealing.</p>
